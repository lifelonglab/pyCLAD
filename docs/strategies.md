# Strategies

### Overview 

Many real-world domains may greatly benefit from the adoption of lifelong anomaly detection, as they are inherently characterized by dynamic and quickly evolving conditions, as well as recurring conditions [1].


Online anomaly detection methods % learning models 
partially address this limit
ation, providing learning systems with continuous updating capabilities. However, the underlying assumption is that only the most recent information is required to maintain satisfactory performance on the anomaly detection task. In this context, forgetting is a desirable property that allows the model to prevent obsolescence
